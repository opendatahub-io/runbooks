# Runbooks
Runbooks for alert rules on Open Data Hub.

## How To Use

This repository is a collection of runbooks for alerts found in an installation of Open Data Hub. These runbooks are intended to guide a user through the steps of troubleshooting any issues that may arise causing an alert to fire.

## Repository Layout

Runbooks in this repository will be grouped by the component that is responsible for the respective alert. 

Example structure:

`root/alerts/component_name/alert_name.md`

## Onboarding

If your component has not added any runbooks previously, please create a subfolder following the repository layout and place an OWNERS file in it. The OWNERS file should be the same as the one in the main repository. Additionally add all runbooks to said folder that you want to contribute.
